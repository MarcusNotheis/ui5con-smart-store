# Application bar

Let`s create this beautiful application bar!
![Alt text](./step1.png?raw=true "App bar")

1. Remove the following files (generated by default) as they would not be needed.
	- src/index.css
	- src/serviceWorker.js
	- src/logo.svg

2. Remove the usage of those files from the ```src/index.js```.

	```js 
	import './index.css';
	import * as serviceWorker from './serviceWorker';
	serviceWorker.unregister();
	```
	
3. Rename the `App.js` file to `App.jsx`. 
   This is not required, but I prefer the convention of having the `jsx` file extension for React components.

4. We will use the `Shellbar` for an app bar, so let's import it in the `src/App.js`. The component has several convenient attributes that we are going to use.
Note: We are replacing the `Button` from the previous step with the `ShellBar`.

	```js 
	import "@ui5/webcomponents-react/lib/ShellBar";

	function App() {
		return (
			<ShellBar
				primaryTitle="Smart Store Manager"
				showNotifications
				showProductSwitch
				showCoPilot>
			</ShellBar>
		);
	}
	```

5. Create "img" folder under "src" and copy the `logo.png` and `profile.png` files from `src/img` from [Sources of Smart Store](https://github.com/MarcusNotheis/ui5con-smart-store/tree/master/src/img) (look for a "download" button, when you click on one of the images).

6. Then, import those images and set them to the `logo` and `profile` attributes of the `ShellBar`.

	```js 
	import profile from "./img/profile.png";
	import logo from "./img/logo.png";
	import "@ui5/webcomponents-react/lib/ShellBar";

	function App() {
		return (
			<ShellBar
			    primaryTitle="Smart Store Manager"
			    showNotifications
			    showProductSwitch
			    showCoPilot
			    profile={profile}
			    logo={logo}>
			</ShellBar>
		);
	}
	```
